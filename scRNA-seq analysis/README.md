# Scripts to analyse scRNA-seq 
Supported analysis:
* Processing scRNA-seq data that is pre-processed by Kalisto Bustools (KB) using scater and seurat (scRNA-seq_KB_data_analyzing_script). 
* Peforming velocity analyisis (by Velocito.R) on scRNA-seq data (Velocity_analysis_on_scRNA-seq) The input for the velocity analysis is a seurat object containing the normalized and scaled spliced and unspliced counts as wel as information on highest variable genes (HVGs) and demensional reductions (UMAP).
